# MEOW YOU SEE ME
## These cats love playing hide and seek, and so will you.
This chrome extension hides collectable cats on every webpage you visit.
More collectable cats with unique features are added all the time, and you don't need to redownload or update to get them!

## Add To Chrome: 
take the same steps as shown in 2:27-3:10 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM0b95lquso&t=147)
### Update Warning: 
To update, loading a new unpacked folder and deleting the old one will delete all your cats! Instead, you should download and unzip the updated version, delete the inner contents of your old unzipped folder (without deleting the folder) and add in the contents of the updated folder via copy/paste, drag/drop, or some other method. Then hit the refresh icon on Meow You See Me in the [chrome extension page](chrome://extensions) (chrome://extensions) to load the update
