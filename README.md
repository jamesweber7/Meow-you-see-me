# MEOW YOU SEE ME
These cats love playing hide and seek, and so will you.
This chrome extension hides collectable cats on every webpage you visit.
More collectable cats with unique features are added all the time, and you don't need to redownload or update to get them!

add to chrome: take the same steps as shown in 2:27-3:10 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM0b95lquso&t=147)
Update Warning: To update, loading a new unpacked folder and deleting the old one will delete all your cats! Instead, you can delete the contents of your unzipped folder and add in the contents of a new, updated folder via copy/paste, drag/drop, or some other method. Then hit the refresh icon ![](chrome://resources/images/icon_refresh.svg) on the [extension page](chrome://extensions) to load the update
